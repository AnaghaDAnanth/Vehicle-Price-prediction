# Vehicle Price Prediction
This project has been done in light of understanding the basics of working with data. 

- Dataset source: Kaggle 
- Steps performed: Data extraction, Exploratory Data Analysis, Vehicle price Prediction

The project has been built to predict prices of cars using three models - Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. An analysis was made by comparing the performance metrics of each of these models.
The best results were seen while useing the simple Linear Regression architecture.

| Model | MSE | MAE | R |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linear Regression | 3.827586 | 1.304497 | 0.865276 |
| Ridge | 3.930316 | 1.334946 |	0.861660 |
| Lasso |	3.828231 | 1.302588 |	0.865253 |
